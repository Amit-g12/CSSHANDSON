    <h2><strong><em>What is CSS?</em></strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">CSS is not necessary</span><mark>CSS saves a lot of work.</mark> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <br>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</em></li>
    </ol>
    <h3><strong><em>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</em></strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <br>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to link the styles in external CSS files. However, <mark>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</mark>, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element
        and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>

    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
